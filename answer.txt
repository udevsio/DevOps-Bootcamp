2.1        Absolute path is defined as the specifying the location of a file or directory from the root directory(/).
           In other words we can say absolute path is a complete path from start of actual filesystem from / directory
                /etc/samba/samba.conf
          Relative path is defined as the path related to the present working directly(pwd). It starts at your current 
          directory and never starts with a /
                cd ../samba

2.2         C:\Users\Asus\Desktop\New folder\DevOps-Bootcamp    --local path
            https://github.com/eldor95/DevOps-Bootcamp          --global path

2.3         Operating system name, release, and version; node name; hardware name; processor type 
        
        2.3.1            uname -r     ||    cat /proc/version    ||    hostnamectl | grep Kernel  
        
        2.3.2            uname -a     ||    getconf LONG_BIT     ||     grep -o -w 'lm' /proc/cpuinfo

2.4         systemctl list-unit-files --type=service

2.5         ps aux

2.6         cat  /proc/cpuinfo    ||  lscpu
            cat  /proc/meminfo    ||  free

            bash script.sh >> eldor_output.txt 


4.          SSH is an acronym for Secure Shell. It is a generic term that refers to versions of SSH protocols,
            for example SSH-1 and SSH-2, among other things like OpenSSH. While it is often referred to as a version of SSH,
            it is, strictly speaking, a suite that consists of networking utilities that are based on the SSH protocol.
      
      4.1  ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096
      4.2   SSH uses an acymmetric encryption. Private and public keys is generated and stored in local workstation.
            Public key is sent to remote server. Server generates top-secret key, encrypts it by clients public key and send
            it to client. Client decrypts the key and uses it to authenticate the user. Then ssh session is established.
            SSH creates a tunnel between client and server. 

      
5.1         curl is a command line tool for transferring data with URL syntax from a source to a destination. 
            curl uses HTTP protocol by default. 
            curl makes the requests to `google.com`, gets the data returned by server and displays the content of data.

6. Write Dockerfile for repo entity
   - 6.1 Build image from Dockerfile
   - 6.2 Push image to your dockerhub repo -> link to your your public image
