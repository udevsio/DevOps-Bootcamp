4. SSH is a network protocol that gives users, particularly system administrators, 
   a secure way to access a computer over an unsecured network.
   SSH refers to the suite of utilities that implement the SSH protocol. It provides 
   strong password authentication and public key authentication, as well as encrypted 
   data communications between two computers connecting over an open network, such as the internet.

 4.1 ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 > username_output.txt

 4.2 The private key is secret, known only to the user, and should be encrypted and stored safely. 
     The public key can be shared freely with any SSH server to which the user wishes to connect.
     To use SSH you should enter SSH command in the terminal "ssh {user}@{host}". {user} represents the account you want to access. 
     {host} refers to the computer you want to access. Then you should you hit enter and write the password of requested account,
     then hit the enter. If the password is correct, you will be greeted with a remote terminal window.

     You can define your own configuration and rules to establish ssh tunnel. In the sshd_config file all the configs are present 
     you just need to change them according to your needs e.g. Port, PermitRootLogin, PasswordAuth etc…
