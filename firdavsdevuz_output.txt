4. SSH, or Secure Shell Protocol, is a remote administration protocol that allows users to access, control, and modify their remote servers over the internet.
    4.1  ssh-keygen -b 4096
    4.2 private -key        In Private key, the same key (secret key) is used for encryption and decryption
        public - key        In Public key, two keys are used one key is used for encryption and another key is used for decryption

        SSH key relies upon the use of two related keys, a public key and a private key, that together create a key pair that is used as the secure access credential.
        The private key is secret, known only to the user, and should be encrypted and stored safely.
